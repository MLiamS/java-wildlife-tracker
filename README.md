## Wildlife Tracker

An app for the forest service to track animals for an environmental impact study.

### Description

The Forest Service is considering a proposal from a timber company to clearcut a nearby forest of Douglas Fir. Before this proposal may be approved, they must complete an environmental impact study. This application was developed to allow Rangers to track wildlife sightings in the area.

### Setup

To create the necessary databases, launch postgres, then psql, and run the following commands:

* psql wildlife_tracker < wildlife_tracker.sql
